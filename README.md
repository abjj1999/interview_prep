## 1. Scripting Languages (JavaScript, Shell, Bash, Python)

### Overview

This section is dedicated to the scripting languages you need to be proficient in for the interview: JavaScript, Shell/Bash, and Python. Mastery of these languages will not only help you answer technical questions but also demonstrate your ability to handle real-world programming tasks. Below is a breakdown of each language, key concepts to review, and exercises to solidify your understanding.

### JavaScript

#### Core Concepts
- **Closures:** 
  - **What Are They?** Closures are functions that remember the environment in which they were created. A closure allows a function to access variables from an outer function’s scope even after the outer function has finished executing.
  - **Why They Matter:** Understanding closures is crucial for creating private variables and callback functions. They’re commonly used in event handlers, asynchronous programming, and function factories.
  - **Practice:** Write a function that generates another function (a factory function) using closures to encapsulate private data.

- **Event Delegation:**
  - **What Is It?** Event delegation is a technique where you add a single event listener to a parent element to manage events for its children, especially useful for dynamic content.
  - **Why It Matters:** It enhances performance and simplifies code by reducing the number of event listeners in your application.
  - **Practice:** Create a list where clicking any item triggers an alert, but only one event listener is attached to the list's parent element.

- **Prototypes:**
  - **What Are They?** JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
  - **Why They Matter:** Prototypes are fundamental to understanding how JavaScript’s inheritance model works, which is different from classical inheritance in languages like Java or C++.
  - **Practice:** Implement a simple class-like structure using function constructors and prototypes. Extend an object with additional methods via its prototype.

#### Asynchronous Programming
- **Promises & Async/Await:**
  - **What Are They?** Promises are objects representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, while async/await provides a more readable way to work with promises.
  - **Why They Matter:** Modern JavaScript applications rely heavily on asynchronous operations, such as API calls. Mastering these concepts is essential for writing clean, maintainable code.
  - **Practice:** Convert a callback-based function into a promise-based function. Then, refactor it using async/await for more straightforward error handling and control flow.

- **Error Handling:**
  - **What Is It?** Handling errors in asynchronous code can be tricky but is essential for creating robust applications. Using `.catch` with promises or try/catch with async/await helps manage errors gracefully.
  - **Why It Matters:** Without proper error handling, your application may fail silently or crash, leading to a poor user experience.
  - **Practice:** Write a function that fetches data from an API and handles potential errors using async/await. Implement both success and failure scenarios.

#### Data Manipulation
- **Array Methods:**
  - **What Are They?** JavaScript provides powerful array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for manipulating arrays in a functional programming style.
  - **Why They Matter:** These methods allow you to write more concise, readable, and expressive code, making data processing tasks much simpler.
  - **Practice:** Given an array of numbers, use `map` to double each number, `filter` to remove odd numbers, and `reduce` to sum the remaining numbers. Chain these methods together for a single operation.

### Python

#### Basic Syntax and Data Structures
- **Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples:**
  - **What Are They?** These are fundamental data structures in Python. Lists are ordered and mutable, dictionaries are key-value pairs, sets are unordered collections of unique elements, and tuples are immutable sequences.
  - **Why They Matter:** Understanding when and how to use each data structure is crucial for writing efficient and effective Python code.
  - **Practice:** Create a small program that uses each of these data structures to solve a simple problem, such as counting word frequencies in a text.

- **Comprehensions:**
  - **What Are They?** Comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists, dictionaries, and sets by iterating over sequences and optionally filtering elements.
  - **Why They Matter:** They allow for more readable and often faster code compared to traditional loops.
  - **Practice:** Write a list comprehension that generates a list of squares for all even numbers in a given range.

#### OOP in Python
- **Classes & Inheritance:**
  - **What Are They?** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python allows you to define classes to create objects that encapsulate both data and behavior. Inheritance enables one class to inherit properties and methods from another.
  - **Why They Matter:** OOP is a cornerstone of modern programming, allowing for more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
  - **Practice:** Create a base class `Animal` with methods like `speak` and `move`. Then, create subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat` that inherit from `Animal` and override some of its methods.

- **Decorators:**
  - **What Are They?** Decorators are a way to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without permanently modifying their code.
  - **Why They Matter:** Decorators are a powerful feature for adding functionality like logging, timing, or access control to functions in a clean and reusable way.
  - **Practice:** Write a decorator that logs the execution time of a function. Apply this decorator to a function that performs a computation-intensive task.

#### Libraries
- **Pandas, NumPy, etc.:**
  - **What Are They?** Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis, while NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of numeric data.
  - **Why They Matter:** These libraries are essential for anyone working with data in Python, providing powerful tools for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.
  - **Practice:** Load a dataset using Pandas, perform some basic data cleaning (e.g., handling missing values), and generate summary statistics. Use NumPy to perform some numerical operations on the dataset.

### Shell/Bash

#### Common Commands
- **Text Processing:**
  - **What Is It?** Shell commands like `grep`, `awk`, and `sed` are used to search, filter, and edit text streams or files.
  - **Why They Matter:** These tools are indispensable for anyone working in a Unix-like environment, enabling quick and efficient text processing on the command line.
  - **Practice:** Write a series of commands to extract specific information from a large text file, such as log files, using `grep` for searching and `awk` or `sed` for formatting the output.

- **Pipelines:**
  - **What Are They?** Pipelines allow you to chain multiple commands together, passing the output of one command as input to the next, which is fundamental for streamlining complex operations in the shell.
  - **Why They Matter:** Pipelines are key to performing complex data manipulations efficiently on the command line, combining the power of multiple commands into a single, streamlined process.
  - **Practice:** Create a pipeline that processes a text file, filtering specific lines, replacing text patterns, and outputting the final result to another file.

#### Scripting
- **Script Writing:**
  - **What Is It?** Shell scripting involves writing a sequence of commands in a file to automate tasks. Scripts can range from simple automation to complex multi-step processes.
  - **Why They Matter:** Automation through scripting saves time and reduces errors in repetitive tasks, making you more efficient and effective in managing systems.
  - **Practice:** Write a shell script that automates a common task, such as backing up files, rotating logs, or monitoring system resources. Include conditionals and loops to handle different scenarios.

## 2. Front-End Development (React)

### Overview

This section focuses on React, a powerful front-end library for building user interfaces. Mastering React is essential for modern front-end development, especially for roles that require strong front-end skills. This guide covers the core concepts, advanced topics, and hands-on exercises to help you prepare thoroughly for your interview.

### React Fundamentals

#### Component-Based Architecture
- **Functional & Class Components:**
  - **What Are They?** Components are the building blocks of a React application. Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX, while class components are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`.
  - **Why They Matter:** Understanding the differences between functional and class components is essential because it affects how you manage state, lifecycle methods, and hooks.
  - **Practice:** Create both functional and class components that display user information. Use props to pass data to these components and render them conditionally.

- **State and Props:**
  - **State:** State represents the mutable data that can change over time within a component. It is managed within the component itself and can be updated using the `setState` method in class components or the `useState` hook in functional components.
  - **Props:** Props are immutable inputs passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow data to flow down the component tree, enabling dynamic rendering based on parent data.
  - **Why They Matter:** State and props are fundamental to React’s declarative approach. They control what gets rendered in the UI based on data and user interactions.
  - **Practice:** Build a counter component using state, and pass a step value as a prop to increment or decrement the counter.

- **Lifecycle Methods (Class Components):**
  - **What Are They?** Lifecycle methods are hooks that allow you to run code at specific points during a component's life (mounting, updating, unmounting).
  - **Why They Matter:** Understanding lifecycle methods is critical for managing side effects, fetching data, and optimizing performance in class components.
  - **Practice:** Implement `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in a class component to fetch data from an API when the component mounts, and clean up resources when it unmounts.

- **Functional Components with Hooks:**
  - **What Are They?** Hooks are special functions that allow you to "hook into" React features in functional components. The most common hooks are `useState` and `useEffect`.
  - **Why They Matter:** Hooks provide a powerful way to manage state and side effects in functional components, making them more versatile and reducing the need for class components.
  - **Practice:** Convert a class component to a functional component using hooks. Use `useState` to manage local state and `useEffect` to handle side effects like data fetching.

### Hooks

#### useState & useEffect
- **useState:**
  - **What Is It?** `useState` is a hook that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it.
  - **Why It Matters:** State management is essential for creating dynamic and interactive UIs. `useState` is the foundation for managing component-level state in functional components.
  - **Practice:** Create a form component that uses `useState` to manage input values and dynamically display them as they change.

- **useEffect:**
  - **What Is It?** `useEffect` is a hook for performing side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually updating the DOM. It runs after the component renders and can be configured to run only when specific state values change.
  - **Why It Matters:** Side effects are an integral part of React components, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or DOM manipulation.
  - **Practice:** Use `useEffect` to fetch data from an API when a component mounts and display the data in the component. Implement cleanup logic to avoid memory leaks when the component unmounts.

#### Custom Hooks
- **What Are They?** Custom hooks are functions that allow you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components. They follow the same rules as React hooks (e.g., starting with "use").
  - **Why They Matter:** Custom hooks promote code reuse and modularity by encapsulating logic that can be shared across components.
  - **Practice:** Create a custom hook `useWindowWidth` that returns the current window width. Use this hook in a component to conditionally render content based on screen size.

### Routing

#### React Router
- **What Is It?** React Router is a standard library for routing in React applications. It enables you to build single-page applications (SPAs) with dynamic routing and navigation between different views or pages.
  - **Why It Matters:** Routing is fundamental for any multi-page application, allowing you to control what content is displayed based on the URL and manage navigation history.
  - **Practice:** Set up a simple React application with React Router. Create multiple routes (`/home`, `/about`, `/contact`) and corresponding components. Implement navigation links to switch between these routes.

#### Nested Routes & Dynamic Routing
- **Nested Routes:**
  - **What Are They?** Nested routes allow you to define routes within routes, enabling complex layouts and component hierarchies.
  - **Why They Matter:** They are useful for building applications with hierarchical navigation structures, such as dashboards with side menus.
  - **Practice:** Create a dashboard with nested routes, where different sections (e.g., Profile, Settings) are rendered within a common layout.

- **Dynamic Routing:**
  - **What Is It?** Dynamic routing allows routes to accept parameters and render content based on those parameters. For example, a user profile page might use a dynamic route to load different user data based on the user ID in the URL.
  - **Why It Matters:** Dynamic routes make your application flexible and capable of rendering content based on dynamic data, which is essential for many real-world applications.
  - **Practice:** Implement a dynamic route that takes a `:userId` parameter and fetches/display user data based on the ID.

- **Route Protection:**
  - **What Is It?** Route protection involves restricting access to certain routes based on conditions like authentication status. Protected routes ensure that only authorized users can access certain parts of your application.
  - **Why It Matters:** Securing routes is crucial for applications that manage sensitive or private information.
  - **Practice:** Implement a protected route that redirects unauthenticated users to a login page. Use a mock authentication system to toggle between authenticated and unauthenticated states.

### Advanced React

#### State Management

##### Redux/Context API
- **Redux:**
  - **What Is It?** Redux is a state management library that provides a centralized store for managing the state of your entire application. It uses actions and reducers to update the state predictably.
  - **Why It Matters:** Redux is especially useful for managing complex state in large applications where state needs to be shared across many components.
  - **Practice:** Set up Redux in a React application. Create actions, reducers, and a store to manage the state of a todo list application.

- **Context API:**
  - **What Is It?** The Context API is a built-in React feature that allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
  - **Why It Matters:** The Context API is a simpler alternative to Redux for smaller applications or for managing global state that doesn't require the complexity of Redux.
  - **Practice:** Implement the Context API to manage a theme (light/dark mode) in a React application. Allow users to toggle between themes, and use the context to apply the selected theme across all components.
